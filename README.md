HotkeyBB is an extension for Opera web browser allowing inserting BB codes and HTML tags into input fields with hotkeys.

You may simply insert BB-code tag pair or surround the selected text. Complicated tags with option (like [tag="option"]text[/tag]) are also supported. Depending on tag properties, you'll be prompted for option value or the selected text will be used as option.
HotkeyBB also supports URL-based site-specific options. You may adjust some tag insertion options according to the site requirements. Available options include: quote mode for tag option, tag bracket style (BB-code or HTML) and tag case.
Warning! Extension intersepts ALL shortcuts including standard ones, so beware of defining such combinations as Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-A. However this happens only when input focus is within a textarea; when it isn't, shortcuts are working as usual.
